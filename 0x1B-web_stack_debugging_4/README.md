## Task 0: Sky is the Limit

In this task, the challenge is to improve the performance of a web server setup featuring Nginx. By simulating HTTP requests using ApacheBench, we identify failed requests and work to reduce them to zero. Logs are used to diagnose and solve the issue.

The solution can be found in the file `0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`.

## Task 1: User Limit

In this task, we need to modify the OS configuration to allow the `holberton` user to log in and open files without encountering any error message. Adjusting the OS configuration, ensures that the user can perform these operations smoothly.

The solution can be found in the file `1-user_limit.pp`.
